# MacGuevar RetroBoard

Fork of [bootsector's PS3PadMicro](https://github.com/bootsector/PS3PadMicro).

A few mods and quality of life features that have been / will be implemented on top of the original code;

- 1 ms polling;
- SOCD cleaner for use with mixboxes;
- Pinout compatible with [DaemonBite's Arcade Encoder](https://github.com/MickGyver/DaemonBite-Arcade-Encoder);
- Home button gets its own pin;
- State1 switch to choose between Left Stick, Digital Pad, and Right Stick;
- State2 switch to choose between *Normal* and *Tournament* mode (Start, Select, and Home turned off);
- Autofire

Additionally, a PCB will eventually be designed for ease of use in actual fightsticks.

## Why "RetroBoard"?
Mainly because its a PS3 controller, and because my intended use case is gaming on older consoles.
